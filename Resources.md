## Learning and Computing Resources

Lastly, for a quick tutorial see the [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com). This is a 2-hour self-paced interactive course on the basics of using MATLAB. The other self-paced courses on that page are freely available to NYU and students can share completion certificates on LinkedIn.

**Do not use sym in Matlab**, i.e., do not use symbolic algebra in this class. This class is about computing with floating-point numbers, not symbolic computing, which is an important but distinct tool. If you want to use symbolic algebra, I strongly suggest using Mathematica (e.g. via Wolfram alpha) or Maple (the symbolic algebra in Matlab is just an interface to Maple's core) or Sage.
