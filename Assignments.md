Please submit solutions via NYU's class management system Brightspace as a self-contained PDF report that is organized with a discussion, figures, and results/answers, along with source codes (plain text please) as attachments. Please do not include codes in the PDF, attach them separately as a zip file or plain text .m or .py files.

### 1. (Due Sept 19th) [Basic methods for advection-diffusion equations](Assignments/BasicAdvDiff.pdf)

The purpose of this assignment is to help me evaluate the background of the students in the class and see what I can assume is familiar and thus tailor the contents better. Please invest some effort into this assignment even if it seems boring (that is a good sign; I will try to challenge most of you), and try to finish it and submit it as soon as you can. You will all come back to (pieces of) this homework later and improve upon your solution until it is "good enough," so the effort spent on it will pay out in the longer term.
