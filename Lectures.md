### 1. (Sept 8th) [Introduction and background](Lectures/IntroNumPDEs.pdf)

We will begin class with the foundation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by reviewing the basic formulation of [advection-diffusion equations](Lectures/AdvDiffEqs.pdf).

### 1. (Sept 8th and 15th) [Basic Finite Volume Methods](Lectures/BasicFVM.pdf)

Please go through chapter 10 in the Finite Difference (FD) textbook of LeVeque, as most of that applies also to finite volume methods. This [Maple worksheet](Lectures/ThirdOrderUpwind.pdf] ([as Maple file](Lectures/ThirdOrderUpwind.mw)) shows that the 3rd-order upwind biased spatial discretization of advection is 3rd order only as a FV scheme for non-constant advection, but not when viewed as an FD scheme.
