**Do not use sym in Matlab**, i.e., do not use symbolic algebra in this class. This class is about computing with floating-point numbers, not symbolic computing, which is an important but distinct tool. If you want to use symbolic algebra, I strongly suggest using Mathematica (e.g. via Wolfram alpha) or Maple (the symbolic algebra in Matlab is just an interface to Maple's core) or Sage.
